Function LGO-CV( matrix, n_genera ):
  n_samples = number of rows of matrix
  n_correct = 0
  for each group g (LGO fold):
    The test samples are those from group g
    The training samples are all remaining samples
    Do floating search on training samples with n_genera genera
    Build LDA model with training data filtered to selected genera
    Predict test data with the LDA model
    n_correct += number samples correctly classified
  return n_correct/n_samples
